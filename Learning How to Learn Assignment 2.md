Challenge
========================================================

- Learning challenges identified
     - A young grade school child, call her Jane, who has ADHD
     - Jane is good at arithmetic, but has difficulty with word problems
          - Root cause: inability to focus
     - Jane also resists attempting self-perceived difficult problems
     - Jane has trouble with reading comprehension
          - Probable cause: inability to focus
     - Jane, like me, tend to procrastinate
     - Jane does not exercise enough

My Qualifications
========================================================

- Two M.S. degrees: Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics
- Taught a sophomore level univerity course
- Have several profesisonal certifications
- Taken many MOOCs
- Quite athletic and like to exercise
     
My Challenges
===

- Tend to procrastinate
- Have some ADHD tendencies, though not diagnosed
- Easily distracted
     - Stupid internet :)
- Read slower than most people
- No patience whatsoever
     - Want to do things as fast as possible in as short of time as possible
- Very light sleeper (total bummer)
     - Maybe my diffuse sleeping brain works overtime
     
Learning Techniques to Use with Jane
===

- Pomodoro technique to help Jane learn in small chunks
- Manage her learning schedule to help her spread out her learning over a longer period of time
- Interleave her reading, science and math lessons to help her get better at word problems
- Train her to picture funny neumonics to aid her in memorization and association
     - North, South, East, West: <b>N</b>ever <b>e</b>at <b>s</b>our <b>w</b>atermelons
     - Lines on the treble clef: <b>E</b>very <b>g</b>ood <b>b</b>oy <b>d</b>oes <b>f</b>ine

Learning Techniques to Use with Jane Cont'd
===

- Integrate more exercise into her free time
     - Build up those neurons
- Have her write, not type, the steps required to solve a problem
     - If she can fully explain a step, require her to focus on that step using Pomodoro
- After short focused attention, just have some fun time
- Force her not to procrastinate
- Have her teach her subject matter
     - Teaching a subject reinforces learning that subject

Improve on Daddy's Learning
===

- Apply the same technique as listed above for Jane
- Before this MOOC, I never formally knew how to learn
     - I did apply some of the techniques learned here before, just now I have more in my toolbox
- Apply patience to not cram in so much at one sitting
- Use exercise as diffuse mode time
     
Progress Status
===

- So far no techniques have been applied with Jane
- Will start ASAP
- Strongly believe that we will see some good progress with Jane's learning
- Jane, at one time, wanted to be a teacher.  Maybe these techniques will help her discern if she really wants to be a teacher over time.
